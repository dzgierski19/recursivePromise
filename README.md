Create a function that recursively iterates through all elements of a promises array.
The results of executed promises should be returned upon reaching the end of the array.
For the purpose of the task, we assume that each element of the array is a promise, and there are at least 4 promises.
If an error occurs in any promise, it should be thrown along with the results of the already executed promises.
Complete the task using async/await operators and without them.
